* Consider: Add a sticky header or menu to the page to make some things easy to always access:
  - show/hide everything
  - pre-select mode
  - jump to top/bottom
* Add show/hide everything functionality.
  * Always show both the "show everything" and "hide everything" options.
  * When the "show everything" button is clicked:
    1. Make the button disappear.
    2. show(0) all cardset-cards, and card-description elements inside not-showing expansion-cardsets and card elements.
    3. show(100) on all the not-showing expansion-cardsets, cardset-cards, and card-description elements.
  * When the "hide everything" button is clicked:
    1. Make the button disappear.
    2. hide(0) on all not-showing card-description, cardset-cards, and expansion-cardsets elements.
    3. hide(100) on all showing card-description, cardset-cards, and expansion-cardsets elements.
  * For the hide, I might be able to just hide(100) everything that should be hidden. Just make sure it doesn't re-animate when already hidden.
* Consider: Add a way to show/hide all card descriptions.
  - Cards not showing would stay not showing, but all description areas would be expanded (and button names changed).
  - Have this available on an expansion and/or cardset level?
  - Maybe the show/hide everything options only affect expansions and cardsets?
* Consider: Add a way to deselect everything?
  - Maybe also have it deselect pre-selected cards?
  - Maybe have it clear out the output?
  - Maybe have it reset generator options?
* Consider: Tweak the min/max card counts?
  - Always have at least 1 $0-2 card?
  - Somehow define that there should be at least 2 cards $0-3 (along with current definitions).
  - Always have at least 1 $6+ card?
  - Is there a better way of defining/controlling this?
  - If people can select cards they want included, I can worry less about generating less than 10 cards.
* Consider: Add a mechanism for people to define specific cards they want included?
  * I need a good name for cards that someone specifically wants included.
    * "Pre-selected Cards"?
  * This will allow the rest of the randomization to take into account the costs of cards already chosen.
  * Have a button that switches to a mode where the next card you select is one to keep.
    * Have two sets of checkboxes but only one ever showing at a time.
    * Normally, the checkbox for selecting a card for randomization is showing.
    * When you switch to this mode, hide those ones and show the other.
    * When done selecting them:
      1. Add them to a new area above the generator.
      2. Select and disable the primary (normally visible) checkbox.
  * Need some sort of page-wide visual indicator when in this mode.
    * Change the font?
    * Change the main background color to something other than white?
    * Reverse-italics the card label text?
    * Hide the expansion/cardset buttons, e.g. "Select all".
* Consider: In the output area, allow cards to be selected to keep when regenerating a set?
  - This is similar to the consideration above.
  - It would allow a user to tweak/refine their selections.
* For the cards that are just placeholders for multiple other cards (e.g. "Knights" or "Augurs"), include all those entries in an expandable area of the card.
  - Maybe have it be an extra area inside the description?
  - So a user would click "Show/Hide description":
    * The main description would show up along with an entry for each sub-card.
    * Do I want each sub-card to have their own independent show/hide for their descriptions?
    * Do I want one show/hide for all sub-card descriptions?
    * Do I want to just show all the sub-card descriptions without any extra hide ability?
* Change the "Events, Landmarks, Projects, Traits and/or Ways" output heading to only have the types actually chosen.
  - Maybe put each type in their own section? It'll almost always just be one section (or none), seldomly two, rarely three or more.
* Provide more details in the "You will also need" section, e.g. which expansion the card comes from and possibly expandable card details.
* Consider: Create some hotkeys to help navigate/interact with the page.
  * I'm not sure how much time to spend on this since none of it really applies to mobile interaction.
  * Make up/down keys navigate showing expansions, cardsets, and cards?
  * Make left/right keys show/hide areas?
  * Make space select things (might already be that way, but check on the select all type buttons).
  * Enter key triggers the generate button.
  * Key to switch to/from pre-select mode.
* Consider: Add a link to the page from flying-ferret.
* Consider: See if there's a way to get the jquery DOM stuff without ajax.
