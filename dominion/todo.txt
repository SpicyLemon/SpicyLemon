* Add a footer with site info.
  - Have an expandable "how to use this site" section, similar to flying-ferret.
  - Make note of no cookies and maybe even note that everything is in the page source.
* Add > v show/hide indicators to the expansion and cardset elements to make it more obvious that there's expandable content.
  * Probably want a generic callback function that can be executed as a complete function on the toggle calls.
  * That callback should be callable by other things too so that it's easier to keep the indicators in sync with the content.
* Consider: Convert the "Show/Hide Description" button to the > v indicators too?
  - Maybe have both?
  - Getting rid of the show/hide description buttons will let me get rid of the hard-coded width on the types area, which, in turn makes the page look better on screens without much width.
* Consider: Add a sticky header or menu to the page to make some things easy to always access:
  - show/hide everything
  - pre-select mode
  - jump to top/bottom
* Add show/hide everything functionality.
  * Always show both the "show everything" and "hide everything" options.
  * When the "show everything" button is clicked:
    1. Make the button disappear.
    2. show(0) all cardset-cards, and card-description elements inside not-showing expansion-cardsets and card elements.
    3. show(100) on all the not-showing expansion-cardsets, cardset-cards, and card-description elements.
  * When the "hide everything" button is clicked:
    1. Make the button disappear.
    2. hide(0) on all not-showing card-description, cardset-cards, and expansion-cardsets elements.
    3. hide(100) on all showing card-description, cardset-cards, and expansion-cardsets elements.
  * For the hide, I might be able to just hide(100) everything that should be hidden. Just make sure it doesn't re-animate when already hidden.
* Consider: Add a way to show/hide all card descriptions.
  - Cards not showing would stay not showing, but all description areas would be expanded (and button names changed).
  - Have this available on an expansion and/or cardset level?
  - Maybe the show/hide everything options only affect expansions and cardsets?
* Consider: Add a way to deselect everything?
  - Maybe also have it deselect pre-selected cards?
  - Maybe have it clear out the output?
  - Maybe have it reset generator options?
* Consider: Don't display:none on the kingdom cardsets so that when an expansion-cardsets area is shown, those are visible at first?
  - Maybe do that for all the cardsets?
  - Maybe only do that for expansions with only the one cardset?
* Consider: Tweak the min/max card counts?
  - Always have at least 1 $0-2 card?
  - Somehow define that there should be at least 2 cards $0-3 (along with current definitions).
  - Always have at least 1 $6+ card?
  - Is there a better way of defining/controlling this?
  - If people can select cards they want included, I can worry less about generating less than 10 cards.
* Consider: Add a mechanism for people to define specific cards they want included?
  * I need a good name for cards that someone specifically wants included.
    * "Pre-selected Cards"?
  * This will allow the rest of the randomization to take into account the costs of cards already chosen.
  * Have a button that switches to a mode where the next card you select is one to keep.
    * Have two sets of checkboxes but only one ever showing at a time.
    * Normally, the checkbox for selecting a card for randomization is showing.
    * When you switch to this mode, hide those ones and show the other.
    * When done selecting them:
      1. Add them to a new area above the generator.
      2. Select and disable the primary (normally visible) checkbox.
  * Need some sort of page-wide visual indicator when in this mode.
    * Change the font?
    * Change the main background color to something other than white?
    * Reverse-italics the card label text?
    * Hide the expansion/cardset buttons, e.g. "Select all".
* Consider: In the output area, allow cards to be selected to keep when regenerating a set?
  - This is similar to the consideration above.
  - It would allow a user to tweak/refine their selections.
* For the cards that are just placeholders for multiple other cards (e.g. "Knights" or "Augurs"), include all those entries in an expandable area of the card.
  - Maybe have it be an extra area inside the description?
  - So a user would click "Show/Hide description":
    * The main description would show up along with an entry for each sub-card.
    * Do I want each sub-card to have their own independent show/hide for their descriptions?
    * Do I want one show/hide for all sub-card descriptions?
    * Do I want to just show all the sub-card descriptions without any extra hide ability?
* On the show/hide description buttons, add a complete function that updates the button text.'
  - Start them all as "show description".
  - Once done animating the show, change it to "hide".
  - Once done animating the hide, change it to "show".
  - Need to make sure they update properly with the show/hide everything actions.
  - I'll probably want a generic callback function for updating button text so that other show/hide actions can keep the button text in sync.
* Bugfix: Min/Max values stop updating with the card count once one is changed, even if changed back.
  1. Click "Show/Hide advanced controlls".
  2. Increase max "$0-2" to 3 (from 2).
  3. Decrease the cards to choose to 5 (from 10).
  4. Decrease the max "$0-2" to 2 (from 3).
  5. Increase the cards to choose to 15.
  * Expected result: As it gets back up close to 10, it matches the defaults and should again start updating as the cards to choose goes up.
  * Actual result: The entries don't change.
  * My guess is that the thing comparing the page values to defaults is using the wrong keys to find things.
* Consider: When horizontal space is limiting, for expansions with a 2nd edition, keep the select/deselect together (on the same line)?
  - When they're on their own line, keep them left-justified with the buttons above them.
* Consider: Create some hotkeys to help navigate/interact with the page.
  * I'm not sure how much time to spend on this since none of it really applies to mobile interaction.
  * Make up/down keys navigate showing expansions, cardsets, and cards?
  * Make left/right keys show/hide areas?
  * Make space select things (might already be that way, but check on the select all type buttons).
  * Enter key triggers the generate button.
  * Key to switch to/from pre-select mode.
* Consider: Add a link to the page from flying-ferret.
* Consider: Change the text on the "Pick Cards" button to something like "Generate Game".
* Consider: See if there's a way to get the jquery DOM stuff without ajax.
