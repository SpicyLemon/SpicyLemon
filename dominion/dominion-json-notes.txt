all.json:
    object where the keys are the expansion names and values are the <expansion card sets> in that expansion.
<expansion card sets>
    object where keys are the card type and values are <card set>s.
    Each of these is also in their own file.
<card set>
    object with keys "name", "info", "cards".
    "name", and "info", are strings.
    "cards" is an array of <card>s.
<card>
    object with keys "name", "types", "cost", "description", all strings.

<expansion card sets> notes:
    All have a "kingdom" entry.
    Base, Intrigue, Seaside, Prosperity, Hinterlands all have: "in-1st-not-2nd", "in-2nd-not-1st"
    Multiple have "events".
    Multiple have "others", but that doesn't really matter.

Special handling:
    "Young Witch" -> pick an 11th card to be the "Bane".
    prosperity -> "Platinum" and "Colony" -> always included/excluded together.
        Have a checkmark for it to randomly make this decision.

        $2+ $3+ $4+ indicates possible overpayments, treat as $2, $3, or $4.
