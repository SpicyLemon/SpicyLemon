TODO:
* Enhance DoCalculation to better handle the discrepancy between <num> and <epoch>.
  Basically, if an arg is a whole number, and `ApplyCalculation` gives an "operation not defined", try it again as the other type.
* Add a flag that allows durations to be output as total seconds or total minutes (probably truncated).
  Either that or make something else that converts a duration string into total seconds or minutes or whatever.
