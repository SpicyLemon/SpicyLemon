TODO:
* Enhance DoCalculation to better handle the discrepancy between <num> and <epoch>.
  Basically, if an arg is a whole number, and `ApplyCalculation` gives an "operation not defined", try it again as the other type.
* Add a flag that allows durations to be output as total seconds or total minutes (probably truncated).
  Either that or make something else that converts a duration string into total seconds or minutes or whatever.
* Allow for stuff to be piped in.
  The way I'm picturing this is that each equation is one line.
  No formula = read from stdin for the equations (if open).
  In a formula, allow for "-p" or "--pipe" or "--stdin".
    The formula will be evaluated to that flag.
    Then, until there's no more lines to read:
    1. Read the next line.
    2. Place the line in the formula where the flag was and finish the calculation.
  Should be able to handle this flag when expecting either an op or value.
  Should be able to be at the start, middle, or end of a formula.
  If no args are provided, check for an open stdin. If open, treat it the same as if only the flag were provided, otherwise output help.
