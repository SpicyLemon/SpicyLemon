# SpicyLemon / bash_fun / deprecated
This directory contains files for stuff that has either been replaced, or is no longer maintained.

## Contents

* `gitlab.sh` - This is the old monolithic version of the GitLab CLI interaction functions.
  It has been replaced with a much more managable and split out set of files in the `bash_fun/gitlab` directory.
  If you were previously sourcing this file, you will want to change to source `gitlab-setup.sh` instead.
