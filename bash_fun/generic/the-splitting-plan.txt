Should be elsewhere:
    provenir_tester     --> Put in the provenir section of stuff as an executable or something...
    kill_sophos     --> No clue where to put this one.

Todo:
    Go back through and note some extra dependencies, and maybe, somehow, version stuff.
    Replace uses of echo with printf.
    Enhance hrr.sh to use subshells for setting the palette
    Look into possible enhancements for jqq to allow the query and jq arguments to be in any order.
    Look into possible enhancemet for jqq to allow just providing the variable name, rather than the entire json content.
    Additional output helpers for stripping more than just colors.
        Need to research escape codes more to know exactly what should be stripped.
