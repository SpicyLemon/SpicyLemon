TODO:
    Replace uses of echo with printf.
    Correct the placement of output redirection.
        Should be after the command.
    Replace "echo ... |" and "printf ... |" stuff with herestrings.
        To find most spots: grep -E "(echo|printf) .*\|" *
        Note that a herestring will add a newline to the end which can sometimes cause problems.
    Additional output helpers for stripping more than just colors.
        Need to research escape codes more to know exactly what should be stripped.
    Add recursive functionality to list.sh.
        Will need to keep track of directories seen (using pwd -P) to prevent infinite loops.
    Create a thing that takes in a URL and gets info about it including where it might redirect to.
        Give it recursive ability so that it can keep on following the trail, getting info as it goes.
    Create a function for displaying color stuff based on a palette.
        Usage:
            show_palette { [[-f] <fg col1> [<fg col2> ...]] [-b <bg col1> [<bg col2> ...]] [-a|--all]| [<pair1> [<pair2> ...]] } [-t <sample text>]
            The -f is really only needed if the background colors are provided first.
            E.g. These commands would be the same:
                show_palette 100 -b 200 201 202
                show_palette -f 100 -b 200 201 202
                show_palette -b 200 201 202 -f 100
            Basically, if the first argument is -f, remove and ignore it.
            Start out putting numbers into the forground array.
            Then, while going through arguments, -f and -b define which array the colors are going into.
            A pair has the format "<fg col1>,<bg col2>"
            If any pairs are provided, the -f and -b inputs cannot be used and everything must be a pair.
            I.e. If -f or -b are provided, or the first color isn't a pair, and then later a pair is encountered, it's an error.
                 Or, if the first thing is a pair, and then a non-pair or -f or -b are encountered, it's an error.
            The default foreground color should be 7.
            The default background color should be 0.
            If pairs are provided, only output those exact foreground background pairs.
            -a or --all only makes sense to provide when not providing pairs.
            If --all is not given, treat all foregrounds/backgrounds provided as pairs.
                If a different number of each is given, loop back to the first once one runs out.
                E.g. -f 28 34 -b 132 133 134  would produce the pairs 28,132 34,133 and 28,134.
                E.g. -f 124 125 126 -b 227 228 would produce the pairs 124,227 125,228 and 126,227.
            If --all is given, output all pairs from the provided list of foregrounds and backgrounds.
