TODO:
    Replace uses of echo with printf.
    Correct the placement of output redirection.
        Should be after the command.
    Replace "echo ... |" and "printf ... |" stuff with herestrings.
        To find most spots: grep -E "(echo|printf) .*\|" *
        Note that a herestring will add a newline to the end which can sometimes cause problems.
    Additional output helpers for stripping more than just colors.
        Need to research escape codes more to know exactly what should be stripped.
    Add recursive functionality to list.sh.
        Will need to keep track of directories seen (using pwd -P) to prevent infinite loops.
    Create a thing that takes in a URL and gets info about it including where it might redirect to.
        Give it recursive ability so that it can keep on following the trail, getting info as it goes.
