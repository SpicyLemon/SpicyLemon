TODO:
    Replace uses of echo with printf.
    Correct the placement of output redirection.
        Should be after the command.
    Replace "echo ... |" and "printf ... |" stuff with herestrings.
        To find most spots: grep -E "(echo|printf) .*\|" *
    Additional output helpers for stripping more than just colors.
        Need to research escape codes more to know exactly what should be stripped.
    Add recursive functionality to list.sh.
        Will need to keep track of directories seen (using pwd -P) to prevent infinite loops.
    Add --pre-process <json_info|jq> option to multidiff.
