TODO:
    Replace uses of echo with printf.
    Correct the placement of output redirection.
        Should be after the command.
    Replace "echo ... |" and "printf ... |" stuff with herestrings.
        To find most spots: grep -E "(echo|printf) .*\|" *
    Additional output helpers for stripping more than just colors.
        Need to research escape codes more to know exactly what should be stripped.
