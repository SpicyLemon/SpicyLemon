TODO:
    Write a README.md
    Create an env var and function for finding the primary branch of a repo.
        Possibly use a custom git config entry for this.
    Refactor git_commit_diff:
        Create a --diff-args flag. Everything after that is added to the diff command.
        Create a --log-args flag. Everything after that is added to the log command.
        Create a --commits|--hashes flag. Everything after that is a commit hash.
        Keep the --commit|--hash flag but make them the same as their plural counterparts.
        Anything not after --diff-args or --log-args is a commit hash.
        Remove the -- special handling.
        New usage: git_commit_diff [<commit hash> ...] [--select] [--diff-args <git diff arg> ...]] [--log-args <git log arg> ...]] [(--commit|--commits|--hash|--hashes) <commit hash> ...]
        Add a preview window to the --select that shows a compact summary of that commit.
        Probably want to have a top/bottom layout with preview/summary on top and commits on bottom.
        Possibly have a hotkey that launches git_diff_explorer on the selected commit.
