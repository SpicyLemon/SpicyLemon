TODO:
    Write a README.md
    Create a function/script to get a file/folder link in github.
        At least start with github. I'd have to look into other places to see how their url paths differ.
        Example github links:
            dir: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/client
            file: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/client/account_retriever.go
            line number: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/client/account_retriever.go#L9
            line numbers: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/client/account_retriever.go#L9-L14
            raw file: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/main/client/account_retriever.go
        github url format: https://github.com/{repo}/{type}/{branch}/{path}
            repo: Get this from `git remote get-url origin`. Will need to parse it out.
                Examples: git@github.com:provenance-io/provenance.git => provenance-io/provenance
                          https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk.git => cosmos/cosmos-sdk
                If https, maybe just remove the .git. If SSH, swap out everything before and including the first : with https://github.com
            type: "blob" for files, "tree" for directories. Will need to test locally to see which to use.
            branch: Get this from `git branch --show-current`.
            path: Get this as input to the function/script.
        Have flags to override the repo, type, and branch.
        Have flag for adding line numbers.
        Will need to do a trick (or something) get take in relative filepaths and get their full path relative to the repo root.
        Maybe also look into the `gh` command line tool to see if there's something already there for this.
        Example gitlab links:
            dir: https://gitlab.com/emaris/frontend/-/tree/master/requirement
            file: https://gitlab.com/emaris/frontend/-/blob/master/requirement/api.ts
            line number: https://gitlab.com/emaris/frontend/-/blob/master/requirement/api.ts#L4
            line numbers: https://gitlab.com/emaris/frontend/-/blob/master/requirement/api.ts#L4-6
    Create a git log explorer.
        Same layout as git_diff_explorer.
        Use `git log --pretty='format:%C(auto,bold)%cs%Creset %C(auto)%h%d %s'` for the selectable area.
        Use `git_diff_explorer <hash> --compact-summary` for the preview.
        Have hotkeys that switches the preview to remove/add the `--compact-summary`.
            Or maybe just include the full diff after the compact summary.
