TODO:
    Write a README.md
    Simplify (or maybe deprecate) git_branch_name.
        Git 2.22 and above: git branch --show-current
        before that: git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
    Refactor git_commit_diff:
        Create a --diff-args flag. Everything after that is added to the diff command.
        Create a --log-args flag. Everything after that is added to the log command.
        Create a --commits|--hashes flag. Everything after that is a commit hash.
        Keep the --commit|--hash flag but make them the same as their plural counterparts.
        Anything not after --diff-args or --log-args is a commit hash.
        Remove the -- special handling.
        New usage: git_commit_diff [<commit hash> ...] [--select] [--diff-args <git diff arg> ...]] [--log-args <git log arg> ...]] [(--commit|--commits|--hash|--hashes) <commit hash> ...]
        Add a preview window to the --select that shows a compact summary of that commit.
        Probably want to have a top/bottom layout with preview/summary on top and commits on bottom.
        Possibly have a hotkey that launches git_diff_explorer on the selected commit.
    Create a function/script to get a file/folder link in github.
        At least start with github. I'd have to look into other places to see how their url paths differ.
        Example github links:
            dir: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/client
            file: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/client/account_retriever.go
            line number: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/client/account_retriever.go#L9
            line numbers: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/client/account_retriever.go#L9-L14
            raw file: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/main/client/account_retriever.go
        github url format: https://github.com/{repo}/{type}/{branch}/{path}
            repo: Get this from `git remote get-url origin`. Will need to parse it out.
                Examples: git@github.com:provenance-io/provenance.git => provenance-io/provenance
                          https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk.git => cosmos/cosmos-sdk
                If https, maybe just remove the .git. If SSH, swap out everything before and including the first : with https://github.com
            type: "blob" for files, "tree" for directories. Will need to test locally to see which to use.
            branch: Get this from `git branch --show-current`.
            path: Get this as input to the function/script.
        Have flags to override the repo, type, and branch.
        Have flag for adding line numbers.
        Will need to do a trick (or something) get take in relative filepaths and get their full path relative to the repo root.
        Maybe also look into the `gh` command line tool to see if there's something already there for this.
        Example gitlab links:
            dir: https://gitlab.com/emaris/frontend/-/tree/master/requirement
            file: https://gitlab.com/emaris/frontend/-/blob/master/requirement/api.ts
            line number: https://gitlab.com/emaris/frontend/-/blob/master/requirement/api.ts#L4
            line numbers: https://gitlab.com/emaris/frontend/-/blob/master/requirement/api.ts#L4-6
    Update git_diff_explorer to handle truncated compact-summary entries.
        It'll be tricky, but I think I can do it like this:
            1. If the compact summary entry has ... in it, and root_dir/entry doesn't exist, assume it's a truncated entry.
            2. Escape the entry for use in a regex, change the '...' into '.+', and wrap it in ^ and $.
            3. Do the diff again, but this time with --name-only instead of --compact-summary.
            4. Grep those results looking for a match.
            5. If only one is found, use that filename.
            6. If none are found, there's an error in my program/logic.
            7. If two or more are found, I guess just do all of them? I'm not sure how best to handle that.
