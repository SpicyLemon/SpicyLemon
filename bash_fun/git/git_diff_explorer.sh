git_diff_explorer - Displays a git diff compact summary in fzf and shows individual file diffs in the preview window.
Selected files are then printed with their paths relative to your current directory.

Usage: git_diff_explorer [<git diff args>] [--commit <hash>] [--output-type <output type>] [--print0] [--printd <delimiter>]

    <git diff args> are the arguments to provide to git diff (see: git diff help).

    --commit <hash> lets you provide a commit hash to get the diff of just that commit.
        It is just a shortcut to providing <hash>~ <hash> as <git diff args>.

    --output-type <output type> sets the output type you want for the entries that were selected.
        This option only has meaning on lines describing a moved file.
        <output type> can be one of:
            old: output a single line with just the old file.
            new: output a single line with just the new file (or the old file if it's not a moved entry).
            combined: output the combined oldfile => newfile entry (or just the old file if it's not a moved entry).
            both: output the old file, and if the new file is different, output that too on a second line.
        Default is combined.
        If provided multiple times, the last one provided is used.

    --print0
        Print an ASCII NUL character (character code 0) after each selection instead of a newline.
        Overrides a previously provided --printd option. I.e. the --print0 or --printd option that is provided last, is used.

    --printd <delimiter>
        Print the provided delimiter after each selection.
        Default is a newline.
        If provided multiple times, the last one provided is used.
        Overrides a previously provided --print0 option. I.e. the --print0 or --printd option that is provided last, is used.

Selection window command: git diff --compact-summary --color=always <git diff args>
Preview window command: git diff --color=always <git diff args> -- <file(s)>

Note: The -- separator cannot be provided to git_diff_explorer (e.g. as part of <git diff args>).

    # Get the compact summary and reverse the whole thing.
    # By default, fzf reverses the provided lines. So if we just got the summary and piped it to fzf, fzf would show it upside-down.
    # We reverse it right off the bat so that the summary line (e.g. "21 files changed, 757 insertions(+), 31 deletions(-)")
    # is first and can then be used as the "header" line (which is really stickied to the bottom).
    # Then send that on to fzf with the following:
    #   --ansi so that the color output from git is displayed right.
    #   --header-lines 1 stickies the first line to the bottom.
    #       Since we reversed the compact summary before giving it to fzf, the first line should be the summary line,
    #       e.g. "21 files changed, 757 insertions(+), 31 deletions(-)".
    #   --cycle so you can get to the top or bottom easily.
    #   --multi so you can select multiple files for final output.
    #   --scroll-off 2 makes fzf scroll the list with the 2 rows above and below always visible (except at the top and bottom of the list).
    #       Because of --cycle, it's easy to be looking at the preview, not paying attention to the list, and not realize you cycled.
    #       This helps with that a bit by making it easier to identify when you're close to the top or bottom before cycling.
    #       E.g. if the highlighted line is at the bottom of the selection window, you have the last line highlighted.
    #   --tac reverses the selectable lines (back to upside-down ordering (stay with me)).
    #   --layout reverse-list then effectively undoes the --tac (back to normal order) but starts fzf with the first line selected.
    #       Without both of --tac and --layout reverse-list, the list is in the same order, but the initially highlighted line is the last one.
    #   --preview-window defines the preview window layout:
    #       top: Put it at the top (with the compact summary at the bottom).
    #       75%: Have it take up 75% of the screen.
    #       border-bottom: Put a dividing border at the bottom to separate it from the compact summary.
    #                      I felt a full border around it just took up extra space and didn't really help anything.
    #       wrap: Wrap long lines so that you can see their diffs fully.
    #       ~2: Keep the first two preview lines visible a the top. These should be the diff command (including filename(s)).
    #   --preview defines the command to run to create the contents of the preview window.
    #       This command is run in a separate enviroment, so it doesn't have access to unexported functions.
    #       And due to shellshock, exporting functions is rarely an option anymore. So we call this file directly with the --gde-preview flag.
    #       We also provide all the args that were provided to this function, but have to escape them specially so that they
    #       translate properly back into their respective arguments.
    #       Lastly, we provide a -- to indicate we're done with args followed by the compact summary line currently highlighted.
    # For providing the args to the preview, they'll need to be escaped and combined into a single string, with each wrapped in quotes.
    # This is better than pargs="$( printf '%q ' "${args[@]}" )" at least in the case where there aren't any args.
    # If there aren't any args, that sets pargs to a single-quoted empty string, e.g. pargs="''".
    # Then when provided to the fzf preview command, there'd an extry empty string argument being provided, which git diff then complains about.
