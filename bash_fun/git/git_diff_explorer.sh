git_diff_explorer - Displays a git diff summary and shows individual files in the preview window.
Selected files are then printed.

Usage: git_diff_explorer <git diff options> [--commit <hash>]
    For details on <git diff options>, see: git help diff
    The --commit <hash> option lets you provide a commit hash to get the diff of that commit.
    It is just a shortcut to git diff <hash>~ <hash>.

For the selection window, --compact-summary is added to the provided <git diff options>.
For the preview window, the highlighted file is provided after the <git diff options>.
